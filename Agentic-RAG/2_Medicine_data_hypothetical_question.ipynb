Structured Outputs with response_format: {type: \"json_schema\", ...} is only supported with the gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model snapshots and later.(Reference: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs). For now, OpenAI and Claude's LLM support Structured outputs. Huggingface's Model usually output plain text. But we can do CoT or other prompt engineering to guide the model output what we expect.\n",

    "2. So Never put the whole parser.get_format_instructions()'s structions into the chat_prompt. Just print it out and copy & pasty useful part into the prompt. In this case, I copy & pasty this {\"questions\": {\"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Questions\", \"type\": \"array\"}} to tell LLM this what I need.\n",
