    "    2. So that we can retrieve relevant docs efficiently based on the query.\n",

    "### Analysis:\n",
    "1. As per the previous stage, we saw each medicine has multiple sub sections. Most of sub sections' contents have less than 500 words.\n",
    "2. The embedding model I choose is sentence-transformers/embeddinggemma-300m-medical. It can handle 1024 tokens at a time.\n",

    "3. I will embedding hypothentical questions instead of the contents. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion: I don't need to split the content that small. I will keep the original content as many as possible. So I will just split the content which's length is larger than 500. \n"
