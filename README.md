## Motivation
While using online pharmacies, I noticed several gaps in the customer experience.

1. Hard to find a proper medicine unless I already know its exact name

2. Search only works with precise keyword search rather than **semantic, symptom-based queries**.

3. I talked with a few pharmacy chatbots, but their answers were vague and unhelpful far from the intelligent guidance people need.

## Features
MediPal was designed to close this gap by:

1. **Comprehensive Medicine Knowledge**

   * Uses an **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system** to provide accurate, detailed, and up-to-date medicine information for responses.

2. **Real-Time Knowledge Updates**

   * Continuously refreshes its knowledge base to include the latest drug data and treatment guidelines.

3. **Advanced Reasoning & Action**

   * Strong capabilities in reasoning, action, and perception for more natural conversations.

4. **Conversation Memory**

   * Remembers previous interactions to maintain context and prevent broken or repetitive dialogue.

## üóÇ Project Structure
The project is organized into four main parts:

1. **Data ETL Pipeline**

   * Scrapes raw medical data
   * Cleans and validates the content with quality checks
   * Schedules regular updates to keep information current

2. **Agentic RAG**

   * Implements properly text chunking and indexing strategies
   * Uses an intelligent retrieval agent to help fetching the most relevant documents for each query

3. **Q&A Agent**

   * Generates accurate, context-aware answers based on the documents retrieved by the RAG component

4. **Front-End**

   * Provides a chat interface that supports both text and voice conversations for an interactive user experience
