    "# MediPal: Your AI Friend for Medical/Clinical Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "MediPal is an open-source medical assistant that provides comprehensive mediciation information and symptom-based recommendations using natural-language understanding which supports voice and message conversation. It is powered by local Huggingface LLMs, embedding model, cross-encoder(BERT) and whisper with agent frameworks like langchain, langgraph and many tools. \n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "Recently I search for some medicine for my friend using online pharmacies, I noticed several gaps in the customer experience when I chat with their AI assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No matter what I say, they just say what they have to say by pre-defining process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Their responses were vague and unhelpful far from the intelligent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I talked with a few pharmacy chatbots, but their answers were vague and unhelpful far from the intelligent guidance people need.\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "MediPal was designed to close this gap by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comprehensive Medicine Knowledge**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses an **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system** to provide accurate, detailed, and up-to-date medicine information for responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Knowledge Updates**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Continuously refreshes its knowledge base to include the latest drug data and treatment guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Reasoning & Action**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Strong capabilities in reasoning, action, and perception for more natural conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conversation Memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Remembers previous interactions to maintain context and prevent broken or repetitive dialogue.\n",

    "## üóÇ Project Structure\n",
    "The project is organized into four main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data ETL Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Scrapes raw medical data\n",
    "   * Cleans and validates the content with quality checks\n",
    "   * Schedules regular updates to keep information current\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agentic RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Implements properly text chunking and indexing strategies\n",
    "   * Uses an intelligent retrieval agent to help fetching the most relevant documents for each query\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Q&A Agent**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Generates accurate, context-aware answers based on the documents retrieved by the RAG component\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Front-End**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Provides a chat interface that supports both text and voice conversations for an interactive user experience\n",
