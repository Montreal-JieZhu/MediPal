    "## Motivation\n",
    "1. **Easy examples with big LLM**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I tried to implement a medical Q&A agent, I saw that many code examples use big models like gpt-4o. With a few lines of code, I can get pretty good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not good for deeper learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is good to learn how to use AI frameworks/tools, but it does not help me understand why and how gpt can do this. For example: How does it do reasoning? How does it break down a task? How does it use tools? How could its talks are always linked to previous conversations?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real project limits**\n",
    "\n",
    "In real projects, we often has limited resource, as we need to manage cost and keep data security. Sometimes we must use small local models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### So this project is not to build a very fancy and powerful AI application, instead **My main motivation is** to use small local models do similar Q&A task just like a big model do. \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "MediPal is designed to have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comprehensive Medicine Knowledge Base**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * I built an **Agentic RAG** to provide relevant and accurate information for responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation and Decision Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Instead of solving a problem at once, it is better to break the problem into small yes-or-no questions. \n",
    "   * The model can evaluate and decide what to do next. By repeating this process, until solve a problem correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversation Memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Remembers previous conversations, so that its talks can always stay connected with the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **External tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Calls wikipedia or brave search tools when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "The project is organized into five stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data ETL Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Scrapes data from medicine websites.\n",
    "   * Preprocesses the data and analysis.\n",
    "   * Implements properly chunking strategy.\n",
    "   * Generates extra questions using local LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agentic RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Combineds multi-vector retriever and re-ranking techniques to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy.\n",
    "   * Add agentic elements and decomposes retrieval task into a series of yes/no questions so that the process go to the right direction.\n",
    "   * Calls external tools when no relevant documents are found in the local vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MediPal - Medical Q&A Agent**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Generates answers based on the retrieval documents with halluciation checking.\n",
    "   * Interacts with users on other topics, but emphasizes its primary role is to provide medical information.\n",
    "   * leverages external tools or MCP services to support users in the medical domain. For example, it can analysize and summarize conversations, then save them to Notion, or even help schedule an appointment with a doctor (Future stage!).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **FrontEnd**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Places Medipal under a API endpoint, so that we only needs to launch it once. Other apps just need to interact with the api.\n",
    "   * Provides a chat interface that supports both text and voice conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * I set exact the same evaluation dataset, metrics and environment, comparing two sets of models. They have almost the same size but one set is general models, another one is fine-tuned on medical documents.\n",
